# JS/TS Interview Project (React)

This is a small project for a JavaScript interview.

## Goal

Create an UI web application that retrieves and displays the user repositories and organisations in Github.

## UX/UI

Up to you, probably it should include an input to enter the username, one area to display the repositories of the user and another area to display the organisations

## Retrieving data

To make things easier we have commited a github-api.ts file with the REST APIs needed to retrieve the information.

## Bootstrapping the project

Up to you, for React we recommend [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) with [TypeScript template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript).

## Submitting the solution

Copy this repository to a repository on your name and add the solution there. It should be clear how to build and run the project locally. **Please don't FORK this repo**

## Bonus (don't need to be in the below specific order)

- Use functional components with hooks
- Use ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring and async/await
- Adding types with Typescript
- Adding a spinner when information is loading
- Deal with errors coming from the backend
- Having a nice UI using a components library (Material UI, Ant Design, etc.)
- Divide the application in different pages and use a router
- Adding state management if relevant (REACT: additional Bonus if using React Context instead of Redux)
- Show common tools used for you daily development environment (linters, code formatter and so on)
- Deploy the project somewhere
